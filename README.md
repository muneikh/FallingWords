# FallingWords
A simple game to identify correct or incorrect falling words.

Summary
-------

 * This is a simple game that took around 4.5 hours of development effort.
 * It took around 15~20 mins to architect the game. It follows MVC architecture.
 * The game notifies how many words are identified as "Correct" or "Incorrect". It also further updates the total number of words and the current word.
 * There could be a skip count for the skipped words and Intrumentation and Unit tests.
 * With little more time, I would like to add (Saving game state, Some animations/vibration effect to notify user of incorrect word, write tests to cover test cases)
