# FallingWords
A simple game to identify correct or incorrect falling words.

Summary
-------

 * It took around 4 hours of development effort and 15~20 mins to architect the game. It follows MVC architecture.
 * The game notifies how many words are identified as "Correct" or "Incorrect". It also further updates the total number of words and the current word position.
 * There could be a skip count for the skipped words and Intrumentation, Unit tests.
 * I would like to (save/resume game state, add more animations/vibration effect to notify user of incorrect word, write tests to cover test cases)
